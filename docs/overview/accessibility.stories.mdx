# Accessibility

A brief overview of this frameworks features and limitations for the creation of accessible content.

## Visually hidden content

Content which should be visually hidden, but remain accessible to assistive technologies such as screen readers, can be styled using the `.visually-hidden` class. This can be useful in situations where additional visual information or cues (such as meaning denoted through the use of color) need to also be conveyed to non-visual users.

<Preview mdxSource={`
  <a href="https://example.org">
    Read more
    <span class="visually-hidden"> about cute kittens</span>
  </a>
`}>
  <Story name="Visually Hidden" height="100px">
    {`
      <a href="https://example.org">
        Read more
        <span class="visually-hidden"> about cute kittens</span>
      </a>
    `}
  </Story>
</Preview>

For visually hidden interactive controls, such as traditional “skip” links, `.visually-hidden` can be combined with the `.visually-hidden-unless-focused` class. This will ensure that the control becomes visible once focused (for sighted keyboard users).

<Preview mdxSource={`
  <a class="visually-hidden visually-hidden-unless-focused" href="#content">Skip to main content</a>
`}>
  <Story name="Visually Hidden Unless Focused" height="100px">
    {`
      <a class="visually-hidden visually-hidden-unless-focused" href="#content">Skip to main content</a>
    `}
  </Story>
</Preview>

## Reduced motion

We include support for the `prefers-reduced-motion` media feature. In browsers/environments that allow the user to specify their preference for reduced motion, most CSS transition effects will be disabled.

# Principles

<br />

## ðŸ‘‘ Consistent

We share components to create pages or products that with the **same look and feel**. Scaling across multiple products or building new products rapidly is easy to do when we share the load.

## ðŸ¤“ Empathy

**Caring about users isn't an after thought**, but baked into our product culture. We model what we ship after experiences users expect. When we don't we give users feedback. Empathy also means **we care about each other** within Masonite.

## ðŸ•— Fast

We choose to **make things fast**. We are determined to deliver first in class products quickly by thoughtful business strategy.
